## Context
Needed a sustainable replacement for the original FlyCam system to support ongoing behavioral assays.

## Contribution
- Led migration to Ender-3 platform for imaging
- Designed and printed new hardware mounts
- Reduced cost while improving long-term maintainability

## Approach
Evaluated hardware options, adapted design for FDM printing, and ensured compatibility with existing software.

## Result
Secured a reliable platform for future high-throughput fly experiments.
