## Context
Our team needed an affordable way to illuminate samples for microscopy without triggering light-sensitive behaviors in certain organisms.

## Contribution
- Reverse-engineered a commercial light pad used in fly experiments.
- Replaced standard LEDs with infrared LEDs for non-disruptive lighting.
- Designed and fabricated a casing to hold acrylic diffusion plates and LED strips.

## Approach
We [(Jacob Vazquez)](https://github.com/Jacob9610) disassembled the commercial pad and identified its key components: transparent acrylic, diffusion film, and LEDs.  
By swapping in IR LEDs and creating a new casing, I produced a fully functional alternative that was previously unavailable.

## Result
The IR light pad provides consistent, non-disruptive illumination during behavioral experiments.  
Its modular design makes it easy to replace components or adapt to other experimental setups.
