## Context
Created for experiments with Stentor to avoid disrupting their behavior with visible light.

## Contribution
- Designed stable camera mount for large lens
- Built IR light tray using diffusion film for even illumination
- Updated code for ease of use

## Approach
3D-printed custom mounts and trays, integrated IR LEDs, and optimized camera positioning for stable imaging.

## Result
Enabled detailed studies of Stentorâ€™s phototaxis and habituation.
