## Design Overview
The Z-stop is a physical end-stop that protects the camera and lens by limiting downward travel on the Z-axis. It ensures repeatable clearance so the optics can’t collide with the build plate during focusing or automated moves.

## Features
- Fixed mechanical limit for safe Z-axis travel
- Sized for Ender 3 mounting points
- 3D-printable; easy to replace or iterate
- Helps maintain consistent lens-to-sample distance
