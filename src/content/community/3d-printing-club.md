Highlights: Founded the 3D Printing and Design Club to teach SFSU students the fundamentals of 3D printing, CAD, and prototyping through hands-on workshops and collaborative projects.

## Leadership
- Established the club from scratch, creating constitution, branding, and outreach plan.
- Recruited members from across disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.
- Organized weekly workshops covering 3D design, printer operation, and troubleshooting.

## Impact
- Provided guaranteed access to Sovol SV07 printer and shared access to Creality Ender 3 & K1C.
- Projects like a **plastic bottle–to–filament recycler** [(Led by Felipe)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-baltazar-de-camargo/) and a hand-cranked sock loom (work in progress).
- Developed a welcoming space for beginners while offering design challenges.
